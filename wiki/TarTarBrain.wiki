#summary AIML Interpractor

Basically we don't need to impliment an integractor to talk Burmese. We just need to select an intepractor that support Unicode. [http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html Intrepractors] can be found here.

  * C# chat bot is too taxing to the server
  * I think Java version will also have the performance issue
  * i don't like PHP and Perl
  * Pascal is out of trend, so as lisp
  * Ruby variance has gone
  * C++ is there but seem inmature
  * I like Python but unstable version

Anyways desktop application should be fine.
